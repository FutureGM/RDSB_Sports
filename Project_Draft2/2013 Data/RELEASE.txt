- See the LICENSE.txt for the license for the data.  A plain language summary of the license can
  be found at http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/by/summary.

- For the sake of brevity, not every column of every file is described here.  Most of the
  columns should be self-explanatory, but some columns are clarified/explained below.

- Columns that end with "Code" (ConferenceCode, TeamCode, etc.) can be present in more than one
  file.  This allows you to relate data from one file to another.  For instance, the team.csv file
  contains a "ConferenceCode" column that references the conference of the team from the
  conference.csv file.

- The "Code" columns allow you to relate the conferences, teams, and players from one year to
  another.  For example, a given player will (should) have the same Player Code for each season that
  he played.
  
- Spot-related columns
  The spot is the number that indicates how far the offensive team is from the opponent's goal line.
  All spots are from the vantage point of the offensive team.  For example, if the offensive team
  has the ball at its own 20 yard line, the spot will be 80.  At mid-field, the spot will be 50.
  If an offensive team reaches its opponents goal line, the spot is zero.  The spot for the
  offensive team's own goal line is 100.

conference.csv
--------------
- Conference Code column: these are NCAA defined conference codes, which can be found in the files:
  http://web1.ncaa.org/mfb/2012/Internet/team/FBS_team.pdf
  http://web1.ncaa.org/mfb/2012/Internet/team/FCS_team.pdf


team.csv
--------
- Team Code column: these are NCAA-defined team codes.  See ConferenceCode above.


player.csv
----------
- Every team has a "team" player that has a first name and last name of "Team."  Statistics are
  credited to the team in certain situations, and this "player" is credited in those situations.

- Player Code column: prior to 2007, the NCAA player codes are used (for the most part).  Since
  2007, the player information has been obtained from the school websites and new players have
  been assigned player codes that do not match the NCAA codes.  The "Team" players still have the
  NCAA player codes.

- Height column: contains the player's height in inches

- Home State column: the two-character state (United States) or province (Canada)

- Home Country column: the ISO-defined country code.  The ISO codes are listed here:
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2

- Last School column: the last high school or college attended

- Uniform Number column: some uniform numbers contain letters.


game.csv
--------
- Site column: contains the value TEAM or NEUTRAL.  TEAM means that the game was played at the
  home stadium of the home team.  NEUTRAL means that the game was played at a neutral site.  The
  NCAA decides whether or not the game is considered a neutral site game or not.


game-statistics.csv
-------------------
- Duration column: the duration of the game in minutes.


team-game-statistics.csv
------------------------
- Pass Conv column: the number of two point pass attempts that were successful
- Off 2XP Att column: the number of two point rush or pass plays were attempted
- Off 2XP Made columns: the number of two point rush or pass plays that were successful.

  The above three columns follow NCAA convention.  If a two-point rush or pass is attempted, then
  it is credited in the Off 2XP Att column.  If a two-point rush is successful, the it is credited
  in the Off 2XP Made column.  If a two-point pass is successful, then it is credited in both the
  Off 2XP Made and Pass Conv columns, with the receiver (and points scored) credited in the
  Off 2XP Made column and the player who threw the pass credited in the Pass Conv column (but
  not credited with an points scored).

- Fum Ret column: This column includes only fumbles that are returned and does not include those
  fumble recoveries where the defensive player just fell on the ball.  Fumble recoveries will be
  properly handled in a later release.

- Misc Ret column
- Misc Ret Yard
- Misc Ret TD

  By NCAA convention, returns of blocked field goal attempts are credited under "miscellaneous
  returns."  Blocked field goal returns for touchdown are incorrectly credited as fumble return
  touchdowns in the official game statistics when they should be a miscellaneous return for
  touchdown.


player-game-statistics.csv
--------------------------
- This file only contains data for players who are credited with statistics in a game.  If a
  player participated in the game but did not record any statistics, then he will not be listed
  in this file for that game.  Player participation will be handled in a later release.
